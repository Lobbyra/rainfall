1. This level is a long program that listen in a infinite loop for the stdin
2. If we enter "service", a space an another string, it is dup in the heap
3. It has the same behavior with the "auth" string
4. The "login" do something with the strings in memory and test if the 32th char of the auth string is \0
5. If it's not, the program display "Password: " and back to the start of the loop
6. But if it \0, it spawns a shell in level9
