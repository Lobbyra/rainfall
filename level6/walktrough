1. We discover a function n that display the flag of level7
2. In the main, there is two malloc. The first one is where the first argument will be copied.
3. The second malloc contains an address of a function that is called at the end of the main.
4. The goal here is to write enough bytes in the first malloc to overlap and write the address of the n function
5. Here is the command to achieve that : ./level6 $(perl -e 'print "1"x72 . "\x54\x84\x04\x08"')
