1. We understood that the program firstly allocate memory, copy the 2 first argvs, opens the passfile and puts something.
2. We make the first copy overflow to the second memory sector to change where the second strcpy will write
3. Here we want to edit the GOT to make the program execute the m function rather than the puts function
4. So as the second parameter, we set the address of the m function.
5. This is the exploit command : /level7 $(perl -e 'print "1"x20 . "\x28\x99\x04\x08"') `perl -e 'print "\xf4\x84\x04\x08"'`
